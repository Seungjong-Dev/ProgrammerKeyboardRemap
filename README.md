# ProgrammerKeyboardRemap

It is focused on typing easily special chracters that are used commonly in SW development.
At my work, I'm using a Ergodox EZ keyboard, which is very convenient to use keyboard layer.
However, at home, I use a 10 keyless keyboard. So, I tryed to get similar effect of using Ergodox EZ.
If you are a developer and want to use a multi-layered-like keyboard, I hope this is helpful.

I use Capslock key as hyper key, that is a combination of ctrl, alt, shift and Widows(CMD).
For examples, you can type common characters for lamda expression, =>, like Capslock + JK.

This script is will updated whenever I decide to add some character or fuction such as F5(Debugging shortcut in Visual Studio)

I will update a keymap later.
